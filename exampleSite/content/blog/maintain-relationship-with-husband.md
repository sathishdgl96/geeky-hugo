Every woman has a dream that her husband will be the best person ever. Most of the times, this dream turns into reality when you are in love with someone. But what happens if your relationship fails? What do you do then? How can you maintain good relationship with your husband after such a big blow up? These are some questions that have been troubling women all over the world!

#### Family is the heart of a woman's life and her husband is her pillar.

Family is the heart of a woman's life and her husband is her pillar.

He is the head of the family and provides for his wife, children and siblings. He protects them from all kinds of dangers with his wisdom, strength and courage. His love is like that which fills up our hearts when we feel lonely because he cares about us so much!

#### When in relationship be honest.

When you are in a relationship, it’s important to be honest with your partner. You should not lie to them and cheat on them. You should also not use your partner for money or any other means of making more money. If you have an affair with another person, then this can be very harmful for both parties involved because they will feel betrayed by each other and they may even break up due to the circumstances surrounding their relationship at that time (i.e., cheating).

If there is anything that goes wrong within the relationship between two individuals who share feelings for one another but also share values on how things should work out then sometimes we might find ourselves feeling hurt because of what happened between us two which caused us great pain emotionally as well as physically due mainly because we love each other so much!

#### Do not compare your husband with someone who has more materialistic stuffs than him.

It is important to maintain a good relationship with your husband. You should not compare your husband with someone else because it will only make you feel bad. You should be happy with what you have, and not compare it with someone else's materialistic stuffs. Comparing can bring up many emotions such as jealousy, envy, rage and anger in the person who is being compared.

#### Respect his family.

Respect his family.

It's important that you respect your husband’s family and his friends. He should have time with them, so don't criticize them or try to make him feel like he is doing something wrong by spending time with them. When discussing things with your partner, avoid talking about other people in front of him and let him know when you think something needs to be said in private. If there is something bothering either one of you about someone else in the family, talk about it privately before bringing up the issue again publicly because this may affect how well-liked everyone thinks each other is!

#### Give him space..!

A husband needs time to himself, time for his friends and family, and also for himself.

Give him space! Your husband has his own life that he wants to live. He may be working hard at work so he can support you and the family financially, or he may have hobbies or interests outside of the home. If this is something important in your relationship then try not to interfere with it; let him do what makes him happy!

#### Avoid criticizing your husband in front of others.

* It is very important to avoid criticizing your husband in front of others.
* It is a very bad habit and it will make your husband feel bad.
* It is very important to respect your husband's feelings, so try not to criticize him whenever he gets angry or upset with you because this makes him feel uncomfortable and alone with his problems, which may turn into fights later on.

For example: “This shirt looks ugly on me”

#### Keep the spark alive by having a date night twice a month.

It is important to keep the spark alive in a relationship. Date nights are a great way to do this, because it allows you and your husband time together without any distractions or interruptions. You can go out for dinner or just stay in and watch a movie together.

#### Show Appreciation to Your Husband.

* Thank him for the little things he does for you.
* Tell him how much you love him.
* Tell him how much he means to you and makes your life better, happier, and more enjoyable than it could be without him in it.
* Show appreciation by saying something like “Thank you so much for taking care of our children while I go out tonight! It means so much to me that we’re able to spend time together as a family even though we don't live together anymore!”

#### Loving and maintaining relationship is not easy but it is not impossible too, efforts are worth to be made

Loving and maintaining relationship is not easy but it is not impossible too, efforts are worth to be made. Love is the foundation of any relationship, love is what keeps the couple together despite all their differences. It's the glue that keeps your marriage strong and healthy, so if you want your marriage to last longer than two years then you need to learn how to love each other even more than before! Your partner needs this kind of encouragement because he or she will never be able to do anything without being encouraged by his/her spouse first: "I'll try harder next time."

Love also means being able to understand each other's feelings better than anyone else could possibly do at this point in time. This comes from knowing each other well enough such that when one person feels hurt or angry about something specific happening within their lives at home (for example), then everyone else knows exactly how they feel inside themselves as well -- including children who may still be young enough for us not yet know exactly what words mean either way yet! If we can all agree on some basic principles regarding how things should work out within our families' homes here today then perhaps someday down road tomorrow everything might go smoothly enough where no one gets upset anymore...

#### Conclusion

I hope these tips will help you to maintain good relationship with your husband.
