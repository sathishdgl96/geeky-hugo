Congratulations on having a baby! You're probably wondering about the health of your body and how it will change after childbirth. While breastfeeding can have its own set of challenges, one thing that's not hard to understand is that there are some changes taking place in your body — and these changes can affect your weight loss efforts. But don't worry! Here's what you need to know:

### Good news! You've had a baby!

Congratulations! You've just had a baby! This is an amazing time in your life, and you've probably been feeling some pretty crazy emotions lately. You might be feeling tired, overwhelmed or anxious—but don't worry—you're not alone. In fact, most new mothers experience these feelings at some point during their recovery from pregnancy or childbirth.

After having a baby (or any surgery), it's common for people to experience changes in energy levels and moods that aren't necessarily related to the surgery itself but rather how they're coping with it physically/mentally/emotionally/etc., so don't worry if one day seems off-kilter compared to another; there are likely many factors contributing beyond what has happened recently.

### Something else you're probably wondering about is your body and weight.

You may have concerns about your body and weight. You are not alone if this is the case, but there are things you can do to make sure that your baby is healthy and well.

* Talk to your doctor. Your health care provider can help guide you through these changes in the days leading up to delivery as well as during pregnancy and after birth.
* Eat healthy foods that are low-fat or nonfat dairy products (like milk), whole grains such as oatmeal or pasta with tomato sauce instead of red meat (which contains lots of calories), fruits such as applesauce made from fresh fruit instead of canned fruit juice—and vegetables like carrots cooked until tender but still crisp! These foods will keep both yourself & baby healthy throughout pregnancy/postpartum period too!

### Some women lose all of their pregnancy weight but may be heavier than before they became pregnant.

Pregnant women may gain weight during pregnancy, but not everyone does. The average weight gain for a woman at term is 25-35 pounds. Some women may gain more, some less. When your body has been pregnant for a long time, it can be hard to get back into shape after giving birth—but if you do lose all the weight you gained during pregnancy and then gain it again, that's called "excess weight." You don't have to worry about this if:

* You've always been overweight and now are overweight again; or
* Your doctor says that losing too much weight would put you at risk for complications such as gestational diabetes or high blood pressure

### It can be difficult to lose weight after having a baby, especially if you're breastfeeding.

It can be difficult to lose weight after having a baby, especially if you're breastfeeding. The average woman gains about 25 pounds during pregnancy and about 10 of those pounds will be lost within the first year of being pregnant, according to WebMD. However, it's not uncommon for some women to gain more than that—especially those who have had gestational diabetes or preeclampsia (a condition in which high blood pressure develops during pregnancy). This type of weight gain is likely due to changes in hormone levels caused by pregnancy itself as well as by hormonal fluctuations throughout the postpartum period.

If this sounds familiar: If you've gained more than 25 pounds since giving birth (even though many women report being able to return back into their pre-pregnancy jeans), then chances are good that part of your problem could be related directly with how much time passed since giving birth and whether or not other factors like breastfeeding could have played into it too!

### Women who breastfeed usually lose more weight than those who don't.

Breastfeeding can help you lose weight.

Women who breastfeed usually lose more weight than those who don't. The extra calories burned while breastfeeding help women get back their pre-baby body faster and burn off the baby weight faster, too. And it's not just about the extra calories—breastfeeding also has other benefits that help you get back in shape!

### Breastfeeding burns extra calories, so it can help you regain your pre-baby body faster.

The extra calories that breastfeeding burns are a crucial part of the equation for getting your body back to pre-baby shape faster. If you're breastfeeding, you should expect to lose about one pound per week. This is more than double the weight loss rate of non-lactating women over the same period, which means that if you've gained 15 pounds since having your baby and have been breastfeeding for 30 weeks (about six months), you can expect to drop around 17 pounds after losing all that extra weight! The good news is that once breastfeeding stops being an issue, these numbers may go down even further—but don't stop counting those calories just yet: Your body uses them up even while it's still absorbing those precious nutrients from breast milk!

### About that postpartum belly...

Your body will change after having a baby. You may be heavier than before you became pregnant, and it can be difficult to lose weight after giving birth.

Some women lose more weight in the first few months of breastfeeding (1), while others see little difference in their appearance or health (2). In fact, some studies show that breastfeeding burns extra calories that help mothers maintain their pre-pregnancy weight loss (3).

### Breastfeeding can delay the return of your menstrual period by several months.

You should know that breastfeeding can delay the return of your menstrual period by several months. This is normal, and it's not harmful to you or your baby. It's actually a good sign that you're breastfeeding well!

Breastfeeding can help you lose weight, too! If you're trying to lose weight during pregnancy, breastfeeding may be more effective than other methods of weight loss because it doesn't require any effort on behalf of either parent (you don't have to eat less food). In addition, there are many benefits associated with lactation:

* Your body will produce more breast milk during pregnancy; this means that even if your baby doesn't like what you're giving him/her right now (or at all), this could change later on down the road when they get older--and hopefully start liking what he/she gets from mommy again!

### When it comes to losing your pregnancy weight, how quickly you shed pounds could be more important than how much you lose.

When it comes to losing your pregnancy weight, how quickly you shed pounds could be more important than how much you lose. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women gain at least 15 pounds during pregnancy, but only 10 percent of women follow this guideline. If you're one of those who did not gain much weight during pregnancy, the ACOG recommends that by six weeks after delivery, your weight should be at least 25 percent below what it was before conception.

However, it's not uncommon for women to lose less than 5 percent of their body mass in the first six weeks following childbirth; this is referred to as "peripartum shedding." As such, many experts agree that focusing on how fast a woman is losing her postpartum belly fat may be more beneficial than worrying about whether or not she lost enough overall weight during pregnancy—especially if she has other health issues like high blood pressure or diabetes (which are linked with obesity).

### When it's safe to start trying to lose weight will depend on several factors, including whether you're breastfeeding, how much weight you want to lose and how quickly you want to lose it.

When it's safe to start trying to lose weight will depend on several factors, including whether you're breastfeeding and how much weight you want to lose. If you're breastfeeding and haven't yet miscarried or given birth, then it may be too soon for a healthy diet and exercise regimen.

If your baby is not born yet but still in the womb, then babies have been known to lose up to 10 pounds during pregnancy due both natural changes in their bodies as well as hormonal changes brought about by pregnancy itself. However, this doesn't mean that women who are pregnant should all eat like they're going out of style; rather they should follow their own individual nutritional needs while also keeping an eye out for any signs indicating possible complications such as gestational diabetes (or diabetes mellitus) which could affect both mother and child alike if left untreated during such times."

### Your body will change after having a baby and there are ways to make sure that it is healthy

You may be wondering what the best way to keep your body healthy after having a baby. Your doctor will help you make these changes, but here are some tips:

* Talk to your doctor about your health. It's important that you take care of yourself and know how to get the most out of life!
* Eat healthy foods—and exercise! If you work out regularly during pregnancy, it will make it easier for you when breastfeeding comes along later on down the road (if that's something that interests you).
* Be careful about what kinds of foods go into your body; don't eat anything fried or fatty because this could lead towards weight gain later in life as well as unhealthy choices such as smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol excessively.
