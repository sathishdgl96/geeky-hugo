Beyonce has a lot of work to keep up with. From her childhood to her music career and film career, she's been doing it all by herself.

#### Childhood

Birth: June 1, 1981

Beyonce was born in Houston, Texas to parents who both had their own music careers. Her father was a gospel singer and her mother taught school for many years before becoming an elementary school principal. She also has four brothers and sisters who are all musicians/artists in their own right: Rohan Marley (gospel), Rayvon (rap), Shayonne (soul) and Korie (country).

Growing up in a Christian household helped shape Beyoncé's upbringing as well as her career path today!

#### Music Career

Beyonce began her music career at age 14, when she signed a recording contract with Columbia Records. Her debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), was a success and became certified 4x platinum within two months of its release. The following year she released her second album, Diva (2004), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and earned Grammy nominations for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance ("Crazy in Love"), Best Contemporary R&B Album ("Diva"), and Best Non-Classical Recording for "End Of Time".

#### Beyonce's third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008; it became another success as it entered at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with sales over 1 million units sold in its first week alone. Her fourth studio album 4 was released in November 2010 by Columbia Records which peaked at number one on both Billboard 200 albums chart becoming Beyoncé's fourth consecutive solo number one album release. In 2013 Beyoncé released her fifth studio album entitled 5 which debuted at #1 on charts across North America including Top 10 positions worldwide including Australia (#6), United Kingdom (#7).

#### Film Career

Beyonce has been in the spotlight for years, and she's had a very successful film career. She has won many awards for her performances on screen, including an Oscar for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Supporting Role for Dreamgirls. In addition to this win, Beyonce was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie (for the HBO special "Life Is But a Dream").

Beyonce has starred in some big budget movies too! For example: The Lion King (voice only), Monsters Ball (voice only), and Dreamgirls (music video).

#### The Formation World Tour

Formation World Tour

Beyonce's Formation World Tour was a worldwide concert tour by Beyonce. The tour began on April 27, 2016 in Miami at the Marlins Park and concluded on October 7, 2016 in San Diego at the Qualcomm Stadium.

#### Beyonce has a lot of work to keep up with.

Beyonce has a lot to keep up with. She's a singer, dancer and actress. She also has a business empire that includes several brands and restaurants. But at the top of her list is music — she's released an album every year since 2003! That's more than any other artist has managed in one decade (except maybe Taylor Swift).

But even though Beyonce is famous for her brand-new music every year, it doesn't stop there: She also performs live shows all over the world — which means she spends money on travel expenses just so people can see her perform live in person! In fact, over the last decade alone Beyonce has toured worldwide at least five times: twice in Asia alone during 2009/2010; once across Europe during 2010/2011; back again across Europe again with another tour alongside Jay Z during 2013/2014; followed by yet another European tour called "The Mrs Carter Show World Tour" which kicked off last month after months of rehearsals ended up being cancelled due to weather issues caused by Hurricane Irma hitting Florida where many people had been evacuated from their homes before heading north towards Atlanta because they feared they wouldn't get there safely otherwise."

#### Summary

The Formation World Tour has been the biggest tour of all time. It has also been a successful way for her to connect with fans. She is still writing music and working on new projects so I think it will be exciting to see what Beyonce does next!
