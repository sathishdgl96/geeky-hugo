Women business owners are becoming more common, but there are still issues facing women in the workplace. In this article, we'll explore how being a woman business owner can benefit you financially and personally.

### Women business owners now make up 40% of all U.S. businesses. (Census Bureau)

Women business owners now make up 40% of all U.S. businesses, a number that has increased by about 10% since 2010. This means that there are more women in charge than ever before!

The Pew Research Center found that between 2000 and 2016, the number of female business owners rose from 28% to 31%, while their share of total employment grew from 22% to 24%. In addition, according to a report by the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), "the most recent data show that in 2012 women represented 48% percent of all workers employed full time or part time but only 26% percent held management positions." The BLS also reports that in 2017 there were 13 million working mothers as opposed to 7 million fathers who worked full-time year round jobs; this trend may be changing as more families move toward dual-earner households where both parents work outside their homes so they can provide childcare services for their children after school hours end each day until dinnertime arrives at around 6pm local time when dinner preparations begin again!

Women business owners are starting more than 1,100 new companies and creating 3,100 jobs daily. The number of women-owned businesses has grown by more than 50% since 2007.

### Women owned firms yield $1.6 trillion in annual revenue in the U.S. (National Association of Women Business Owners).

Women-owned businesses are a growing force in the US, with over 1 million women-owned firms generating $1.6 trillion in annual revenue.

Women own more than 7 million businesses in the United States and employ 7.8 million people, who collectively generate an estimated $1.6 trillion in annual revenue for their owners — that's enough to support each woman entrepreneur's family of four!

Over the last 20 years, women-owned firms have grown by over 600% since 1997 (National Association of Women Business Owners).

### Female entrepreneurs outnumber male entrepreneurs in business creation by a two to one ratio (Forbes).

Women are more likely to start businesses than men. The reasons for this are varied, but one major factor is that women want to be their own boss and don't like the corporate culture of their employers.

In fact, Forbes reported that female entrepreneurs outnumber male entrepreneurs in business creation by a two-to-one ratio (Forbes). It's not just about having a desire or need; it's also about finding an opportunity where you can make an impact on society in some way.

### Being a woman business owner is becoming more common, but there are still issues facing women in the workplace

Being a woman business owner is becoming more common, but there are still issues facing women in the workplace.

* Women are often underpaid. A study found that while men make up 80% of CEOs, they only hold 33% of executive positions at Fortune 500 companies.
* Women have fewer opportunities for advancement than men do. The Glass Ceiling Commission found that women make up only 22% of executive officers at American companies and 20% of board seats on Fortune 500 firms—both numbers significantly lower than their male counterparts (who make up 60%). This disparity can be attributed to bias against female candidates who don't fit within an idealized "male" archetype (i.e., younger vs older) as well as cultural perceptions about what constitutes leadership skills or traits (for example: being assertive). When looking at top-performing leaders from different industries worldwide such as technology startups versus large multinational corporations like Apple Inc., you'll notice how few female executives exist in the latter group despite having larger budgets and more resources available during its early stages when establishing new products/services etcetera...

### Summary

I hope you enjoyed learning about the benefits of being a woman business owner! As we saw above, there are many reasons why this is becoming more common, but it’s still not an easy path to take. We all need to keep working on ourselves and stay committed to our goals no matter how long it takes.
