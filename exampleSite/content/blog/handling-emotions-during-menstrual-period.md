**It's not just women who have to deal with painful periods. So many people have trouble handling their emotions during this time, and it can be tough. The good news is that there are ways you can manage your emotions so that they don't take over your life.**

## Emotions during menstruation

The menstrual cycle can be a very emotional time for women. There are many reasons why you may feel this way, but there is one common thread that runs through all of them: your emotions are strong during this time.

Emotions can be strong during ovulation, menstruation and menopause. They also tend to increase as you get older and begin experiencing changes in your body such as pregnancy or childbirth or breastfeeding.

## Painful periods

Painful periods can be caused by a variety of conditions. Some of the most common ones include:

* Endometriosis - This condition occurs when endometrial tissue (the lining of the uterus) grows outside its normal location, causing severe pain and bleeding. Endometriosis affects 5-10% of all women during their reproductive years and has been linked to infertility as well as other health issues like depression and anxiety.
* Fibroids - These growths occur in one section of the uterus (uterus). They cause irregular bleeding that is often painful but may go away after pregnancy or childbirth. Fibroids are more common among African American women than white women but also affect men who have sex with men (MSM). They usually grow larger over time but shrink back down afterward under certain circumstances such as surgery for removal or medical treatment options such as medication shots administered by doctors at clinics near homes around town where patients live; these medications target hormones produced during ovulation so there's less chance that symptoms will return again later on down line too much damage done already been done already caused irreversible damage already done already caused irreversible damage already happened before then too many times now we've gotta fix this problem so don't worry about anything else just get yourself fixed up right away before things get worse."

## It's okay to feel your feelings

It’s normal to feel angry, sad and anxious during your period. In fact, it can be helpful to acknowledge that you are feeling those emotions.

It is also okay not to express these feelings in a certain way or for a certain amount of time. This means that it is okay if you don't feel like talking about how you're feeling at all times—you may need some time alone or away from other people in order to feel better.

## Conclusion

So remember, it's okay to feel your feelings. You don't have to bottle them up or hide from everyone else. The best way to deal with any emotion is just by talking about it and being open with people around you. It will help you understand yourself better in the long run!
