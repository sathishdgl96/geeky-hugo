I've always been a very proud and protective mother. Of course, this means that when my son was born, I was ready to fight for him with every ounce of energy in my body. And that's exactly what happened: I fought for him! But there were times when I wasn't fighting so much as just existing as mothers —and as people who wanted my kids to grow up healthy and happy, which isn't always easy when all the world tells you is how terrible girls are (or how bad boys are). But now that my son is older than preschool age (and has even started kindergarten!), it's time for me both to change so that I can show him what being an ethical human being looks like—and how being an adult woman should be possible no matter who she is or where she lives.

### 8 Ways to Teach Your Son What It Means to Be a Good Man

* Teach your son about consent.
* Show him that respect means in action, not just words.
* Emphasize that emotion is not weakness and that empathy is crucial to happiness and success.

#### 1. Teach him about consent.

* Teach him about consent
* Consent is a word that can be difficult to define, but it's the agreement between two or more people before any conduct takes place that matters. You should make sure your child understands what consent means and how to ask for it from others (and also how not to ask for it!). For example: "Can I play with this toy?" vs "Would you like me to play with this toy?"
* Teach him about safe sex practices
* Sex is an important part of growing up, so talk openly with your son about the facts around safe sex practices, including birth control methods like condoms and emergency contraception pills (ECP). If there are any questions he has about these topics they might not be able to answer alone, have someone in his life who can help guide him through them—a parent or mentor could work well here!

#### 2. Show him what respect means in action.

You can show your son respect by showing him what it means in action.

* Respect is a two-way street. It's not just about what you say, but also how you act and how you treat others. When we are respectful of others, they feel respected as well—and then they will also be able to treat us with respect!
* Showing respect doesn't mean that we have to agree with everything someone says or does—but it does mean being honest and open about our thoughts so that we can communicate effectively together as equals rather than adversaries (which often happens when people aren't clear about what their expectations are).
* Being respectful doesn't mean agreeing all the time; it means listening attentively when someone has an opinion worth considering before deciding whether or not those ideas make sense for both parties involved

### 3. Teach him that emotion is not weakness.

Emotion is not weakness. It's a sign of strength and love, and it can be found in the most unexpected places. When your son has a tough time at school or gets into an argument with his parents, don't scold him for being emotional—you should praise him for being able to express himself so clearly!

Even when he does something wrong, teach him that emotions are OK and there are no hard-and-fast rules about how you should feel about certain things (e.g., your friend moved away).

#### 4. Draw the lines between sex and intimacy, because they're not always the same thing.

In the same way that sex is not necessarily the same thing as intimacy, it's also not always the same thing. Sex can be used to express love and affection, or vice versa. It's important to remember that these two things aren't mutually exclusive: sometimes you want someone physically close but emotionally distant; other times you want a partner who will give you space but still hold your hand when needed; sometimes both at once!

But regardless of how often we experience these feelings within ourselves (or others), they don't stop there—sex isn't just physical pleasure; it's also an act of communication between two people who care about each other deeply enough for them both to give up something precious for one another without hesitation or reservation whatsoever...and sometimes even after knowing each other for years!

#### 5. Emphasize that empathy is crucial to happiness and success.

Empathy is a key to success, happiness and success.

It’s important to teach your children that they can help others by understanding how they feel and why they do what they do.

#### 6. Don't limit his gender expression or your own, and show him how fun it can be to break free of norms and stereotypes.

You don't have to be a parent to know that gender expression is not just about clothing and appearance. It's also a matter of behavior, which includes things like how you speak, act, and behave in public spaces. Gender performance can take many forms:

* Gender identity (how you identify yourself)
* Gender presentation (how you present yourself to others)
* Intersex status (whether your anatomy falls somewhere between male or female).

#### 7. Give him more than one model of masculinity to choose from.

* Show him that there are many ways to be a man.
* Show him that there are many ways to be a woman.
* Show him that there are many ways to be a human being, and not just the one way you think he should or should not choose.

#### 8. Show him that you love being a woman, and that women are not inferior or second-rate to men in any way, shape or form! (Even if you have to fake it sometimes.)

You can show your son that you love being a woman, and that women are not inferior or second-rate to men in any way, shape or form! (Even if you have to fake it sometimes.)

You can be strong as a woman while still being strong enough to raise your son by yourself. You don't have to sacrifice your femininity in order to be a good mother. In fact, if anything it might make you more of an obstacle for him later on in life when he comes across stereotypes about women and their roles—and believes them because they're perpetuated by society at large.

#### A good man respects women without feeling threatened by them

A good man respects women without feeling threatened by them.

A good man respects women's right to make their own decisions, and he will not try to change them or tell them what they should be doing. For example, if a woman wants to wear pants instead of shorts when she plays tennis outdoors in the summertime, that's her choice as long as it doesn't affect anyone else on their team or at an event like this one (like other players' comfort). She also has the right not only to wear whatever she wants but also how ever much clothing she desires—even if it means wearing things like leggings instead of tights!

A good man respects a woman's body no matter what size/shape/type/color etc., just like I respect yours! There are no double standards here either: If someone tells us our bodies aren't good enough then we should ignore them because nobody likes hearing negative comments about ourselves anyway...i mean really who would want another opinion on how beautiful they look?"

#### Conclusion

We know that raising a good man can be challenging, but it’s not impossible. You just have to keep in mind the things we outlined above, and stay positive about your son’s future. Hopefully, with some careful planning and lots of love, you can make it through this journey together!
