**If you're traveling alone, as a woman and without your partner, it's important to be safe. You can't just go abroad by yourself and think everything is going to be fine. There are some countries that are more dangerous for women than others, and here we've compiled a list of the safest places for women travelers in Europe.**

#### Finland

Finland is one of the safest places for women travellers. The country has a low crime rate, and there are no restrictions on where you can go or what you can do in Finland.

You can travel alone, or with friends or family members. You can easily get around by train, bus or car (but not by plane). Most hotels will give free Wi-Fi access so you don't have to worry about being away from home too long!

In addition to all these advantages, Finland also offers plenty of natural beauty: forests with mosses and fungi growing on trees; lakes surrounded by mountains; rivers full of salmon fishing holes; hot springs where tourists come every year after they've seen everything else they wanted to see elsewhere

## Germany

While it's true that Germany is one of the safest countries in Europe, there are still some things you can do to stay safe while traveling through this country. If possible, avoid traveling alone and at night in general. Always keep an eye out for your surroundings and try not to walk through deserted areas after dark.

If you are traveling with a group of friends or family members, make sure each person has their own room (or hotel) so that if something does happen—you'll have somewhere safe to run! Travelers should also remember how much alcohol is consumed at any given time; too much alcohol can lead people into dangerous situations which may not be there fault but theirs nonetheless."

#### Luxembourg

Luxembourg is the safest country in the world for women travelers.

It's a small country in Europe, with a low crime rate and an excellent quality of life.

In fact, according to the 2018 State Department Travel Advisory: "Luxembourg has been rated as 'excellent' for safety and security."

#### New Zealand

* New Zealand is a beautiful country.
* It's safe and clean, with good infrastructure, a well-developed tourist industry, a good climate and economy, an excellent education system and healthcare system.

## Iceland

Iceland is one of the safest countries in the world, and it's a great place to visit as a solo female traveler. In fact, Iceland has one of the lowest crime rates in Europe. You'll be safe there!

Iceland is also a very safe country for solo female backpackers (and anyone else who travels alone). The Icelandic National Police Force patrols every street and town with police cars equipped with GPS tracking devices so they can follow up on any suspicious activity that may occur while you're out exploring by yourself.

#### Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Austria tie for 5th place

Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Austria are the top five safest countries for women travelers.

According to the World Economic Forum's 2018 Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report, all four nations scored very highly on several other metrics including healthcare, education and life expectancy—the latter two being especially important when it comes to safety. In addition to having low crime rates (Sweden has one of the lowest murder rates in Europe), these countries also score well on corruption indices: Denmark's score was 7 out of 100; Norway came in at 11th place; Sweden was 16th and Austria 19th.

#### Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is a great place for women travelers, as it's safe, beautiful and affordable. It's also a great place to learn more about Buddhism or Hinduism.

The country itself is beautiful and has several popular tourist attractions including the golden temple at Kandy and the ruins of ancient Anuradhapura (the capital city).

## Canada

Canada is a safe country for women to travel alone. In fact, it's one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.

Women can travel to Canada without being scared or worried about safety. They can go anywhere they want and do anything they want without fear of violence or harassment from anyone around them—including men!

#### Barbados and Malta tie for 8th place

For its Caribbean location and beautiful beaches, Barbados is a safe place for women travelers. It's also home to some of the most luxurious hotels in the world.

Malta is another Mediterranean island that has earned itself a spot on this list. It has gorgeous views, great food and drink (and wine), and even more beautiful people who speak English fluently!

#### Switzerland.

Switzerland is a safe country. It has the lowest crime rate among all European nations and is one of the safest places in the world. The Swiss are known for their punctuality, politeness, and cleanliness (a fact that could be due to their gene pool).

Switzerland is also a small country with only about 8 million inhabitants who enjoy being able to go hiking or skiing without having to worry about being mugged by some guy trying to steal your wallet while you're at it! The Swiss don't get as much attention from tourists as other European countries do but they should definitely be on your list if you're looking for an adventure-packed holiday destination that won't cost too much money either!

#### travel tips
