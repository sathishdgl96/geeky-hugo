**Breastfeeding is a great experience for the mother and child. It's also great for your health and can help you feel comfortable in your own skin. However, there are some things that should be avoided when breastfeeding in order to ensure both of you have a healthy and safe bonding experience.**

#### Don't smoke

Smoking is bad for you and your baby. It can cause SIDS, low birth weight, breast cancer and premature births.

It's important to quit smoking before you become pregnant or while you're breastfeeding so that the nicotine doesn't affect your baby's brain development.

#### Avoid alcohol

Alcohol is not good for you or your baby. It can pass through the breast milk, making it difficult to digest and potentially harmful to the baby. In addition, alcohol has been shown to cause sleepiness and make you feel dizzy or sick.

#### Don't do drugs

* Don't do drugs.
* The reason for this is that drugs can pass through the breast milk, so it's important to avoid them if you're breastfeeding.
* Drug addiction in babies and side effects on babies are a serious problem, but they're also common in adults as well—and they're not limited to just crack cocaine or heroin (though those are two examples of some of the most dangerous drugs). Alcohol is another drug that can cause severe problems for babies who have been exposed to it through their mothers' milk (or vice versa).

#### Keep a healthy diet.

You are likely to find that you have a lot of questions about what foods are best for breastfeeding. While there is no one-size-fits all solution, there are some general rules that can help guide your choices.

First, make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients. Your baby needs about 1/2 cup of breast milk every three hours (if he's not hungry). That means there's a lot of food in each serving! The USDA recommends 1 cup per day for both adults and children up to age 6 who aren't growing fast enough on solids alone; however, this may vary depending on how much weight gain the baby has gained over the first two weeks after birth—and how quickly they eat solids again after returning home from the hospital or NICU nursery (see more below). So if your little one seems underweight at six weeks old despite eating well-balanced meals with lots of fruits and vegetables (and avoiding junk), consider switching to formula if needed until he reaches his ideal weight level—but only do so if he doesn't seem satisfied by breastmilk alone anymore."

#### Avoid caffeine

Caffeine is a stimulant and can cause jitteriness, sleep problems, digestion problems, headaches and more. It's also been linked to heart palpitations and muscle tremors. If you're breastfeeding your baby on caffeine-heavy drinks like coffee or soda pop (or even just chewing gum), consider switching to decaf for a while so that you don't give them any extra energy from caffeine—and keep them close by!

#### Pay attention to any medications you take.

Pay attention to any medications you take. If you are taking a medication, be sure that it doesn't interfere with breastfeeding or harm your child. You may want to ask your doctor or pharmacist what the risks are if there is any chance of the medication interfering with breastfeeding.

#### Watch out for environmental toxins.

* Avoid pesticides and other chemicals. Pesticides are common on many fruits, vegetables and even on your skin when you apply sunscreen. They’re also found in many household products such as paints, shampoos and perfumes. Secondhand smoke can be harmful to infants because it contains toxins that are absorbed into their bodies through breastfeeding or contact with saliva from smoking mothers.
* Avoid toxic household products such as insecticides, cleaners containing bleach or ammonia; laundry detergents with phosphates; air fresheners (they may contain formaldehyde); furniture polish (often contains petroleum); floor waxes made with mineral oils that may cause allergic reactions in babies who have sensitive skin or respiratory problems

#### Make sure your baby doesn't get exposed to anything harmful.

* Make sure your baby doesn't get exposed to anything harmful.
* Avoid smoking and alcohol while breastfeeding. Smoking can cause harm to your baby, so do not smoke and continue to breastfeed until the age of 2 years old, or whenever you decide that it is time for them to stop breastfeeding completely.
* Avoid drugs while breastfeeding (including marijuana). Even though there isn't any research yet on how marijuana affects babies' health, it's likely that using this drug while pregnant could be harmful for both mother and child during pregnancy as well as after birth because of the high levels of THC found in these products; therefore we recommend avoiding this substance altogether if possible when caring for a newborn infant at home with grandparents nearby who will watch over him or her around the clock until age 2 years old when he/she reaches puberty which means parents won't need help anymore unless there are other concerns such as illness etcetera then yes but I'd rather see parents avoid any risk before knowing what happens afterwards."

#### Breastfeeding is a healthy experience for both you and your child, and it can be a great bonding experience too!

Breastfeeding is a healthy experience for both you and your child, and it can be a great bonding experience too!

You'll have all the benefits of breastfeeding when you nurse your baby. You'll also get to bond with him or her through nursing. When babies stop crying after being fed by their mothers, they're usually contented and happy—and that's when they start sleeping better (and longer). In fact, studies show that breast milk is more effective than any other formula in helping babies sleep more soundly at night (1).

If you're worried about how much milk your body produces while breastfeeding? Don't worry: there are plenty of ways to make sure that both mother and baby get enough nourishment every day (2).

#### Summary

These tips are just a few of the things you should consider while breastfeeding your baby. There are many more than these and they will all help you in your journey to become a successful, happy mom. I hope that these suggestions have been helpful to you!
