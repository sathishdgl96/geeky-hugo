Children are often taught how to express themselves in a loud and forceful way. However, shouting is only one of many ways that children can communicate. If your child is shouting at you or others in an aggressive manner, it may be time for some training! Here are some tips on how you can approach this situation:

#### Relax yourself.

* Take a deep breath. Shouting can be a passive-aggressive way for children to get your attention. If you respond with anger or frustration, it will only reinforce the behavior. You should also avoid making eye contact with your child while they are shouting at you—this may seem counterintuitive, but doing so will make them feel as if they have won an argument.
* Relax your body. If you have a tendency to clench your fists or cross your arms, try relaxing those muscles. If you are standing, sit down. This will help you to appear less confrontational and more approachable.
* Relax your mind. Try to let go of the negative thoughts that are causing you stress. It’s okay if your child doesn’t always listen to you—they still love you, even if they don’t show it.
* Relax your voice . Try to speak more slowly and calmly. You can also try taking a deep breath before speaking and holding it while you are talking. This will help you avoid raising your voice or saying things that are hurtful or accusatory.

#### Do not react.

* Do not react to the child's behaviour. Try not to get angry, yell, or punish your child. If you do react, it will only make the situation worse. Reacting will also make it more difficult for your child to understand why they are acting out.
* Do not react to the child's words. Do not react to the child's words. Try to remain calm and quiet while they are talking, even if they are yelling or swearing at you (which is often a sign that they feel overwhelmed by their feelings). Your child may be trying to get your attention or express their frustration with your rules. Listen carefully when your child is talking so that you can understand what they are feeling and why they are behaving badly.
* Do not react to the child's actions. When you react to a child's behavior, it can make them feel that they have power over you. For example, if your child is yelling at you or hitting their brother and then you yell back or hit them back, this only reinforces the idea that this type of behavior works.
* Do not react to the child's emotions (anger, fear, sadness).
* Don't try and change their emotions with yours either -- this is not helpful!

#### Get down to the child's level.

* Get down to the child's level.
* Make sure you are not towering over the child.
* Try to use a calm voice, rather than shouting or raising your voice. If you have to shout, try and do so in short bursts at a time and then move on to something else like playing with them or talking about something else entirely (such as what they did today).
* Use eye contact while talking with him/her and make sure they understand what you are saying by showing them how their actions will affect others around them such as other children who might be listening in on our conversation instead of focusing on us alone right now!

#### Tell the child that you need to speak with him in a calm voice.

If you're in a situation where you need to speak with your child, tell him that you want to speak with him in a calm voice. Do not raise your voice or use harsh tones of any kind.

#### Praise the child for good behavior.

* Praise the child for good behavior.
* Be specific about what you liked and why. For example, “You said please when I asked you to turn off the TV and take out your toys! That's great!” or “Thank you for helping me with our project today, even though it was hard work. You're such a great helper!”
* Reward the child with a sticker or some other small reward (e.g., small toy).

#### Help children learn how to express themselves other than by shouting.

* Use words to express feelings.
* Use non-verbal communication to express feelings.
* Use a journal to express feelings.
* Use a punching bag to express feelings (and maybe learn some self-defense skills.)
* Use pillowcases or sheets on the floor as targets for throwing things into them or hitting them with anything else that you can find in the house, like pencils, pens and markers etc., then throw whatever it is at those targets until they break into smithereens! Or just do this while watching TV instead of playing video games all day long!!!

#### Conclusion

The most important thing is that you can learn to calm yourself down in the moment. The key is to respond calmly and firmly, but in a way that doesn’t make the child feel afraid or threatened. You want him to feel heard and respected, not judged or criticized. If you keep this up with your children over time and continue speaking calmly when they scream at you then they may learn how not do this anymore when they are angry or frustrated with life around them!
