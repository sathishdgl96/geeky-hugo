Melanie Perkins is the founder of Canva, a company that makes it easy for people to create beautiful graphics online. She was born in Australia but moved to San Francisco, USA when she was 10 years old. Her parents ran their own business together and inspired Melanie's love for business as well as her mother who runs her own business now too! While at university she studied an arts degree specializing in Marketing and Advertising and then decided to go on and do a Marketing MBA after graduation. After graduating from university she went backpacking around Europe with her boyfriend/now husband who helped inspire her entrepreneurial spirit during this time period too!

Melanie Perkins grew up in Australia, living a fairly normal childhood. She was born in Perth, Western Australia.

At age 18 she decided it was time for her to start a career, and enrolled at the University of Western Australia where she studied marketing and graphic design. While there she also worked as a freelancer for various companies around town including Adobe Creative Cloud (where I work), Microsoft Word and Excel etc., so that helped me get started on my own business ideas later down the line!

##### She attended University in Perth, Western Australia and lived there until she moved to San Francisco, USA.

##### She was inspired by her mother who ran her own business when Melanie was a young girl.

She was inspired by her mother who ran her own business when Melanie was a young girl. Her mother ran a beauty salon and taught Melanie the importance of hard work, determination and self-discipline. This is how Melanie Perkins started her own business at age 13.

It wasn't easy for her as an entrepreneur at first because she had no experience or knowledge about running a successful business but she continued working hard until she eventually realized that it was possible because of all the support she received from family and friends such as my dad Stephen Perkins (a friend since childhood), my brother Luke Perkins (who helped me with marketing) and most importantly my husband Mark Hampton-Perkins (who has always been there for me).

##### While at university, she studied an arts degree specializing in Marketing and Advertising and then decided to go on and do a Marketing MBA.

As a young entrepreneur, Melanie had the opportunity to study marketing and advertising at university. She was inspired by her mother who ran her own business and wanted to learn more about how she could help others do the same thing.

Melanie studied a Marketing MBA, which is a postgraduate course in business management that focuses on practical skills like decision making, leadership and planning while also developing critical thinking skills.

##### After university, she went to work for a public relations firm but wasn't satisfied with her job and so she decided to travel around the world for 6 months with her boyfriend/now husband.

After university, she went to work for a public relations firm but wasn't satisfied with her job and so she decided to travel around the world for 6 months with her boyfriend/now husband.

Melanie lived in a tent and travelled through Europe, Central America and South America from April until October of 2010. She met many interesting people on her travels including the CEO of Coca Cola who gave her his personal cell number just so that he could stay in touch with Melanie when he was away from home.

She also learned a lot about herself by experiencing new cultures and learning more about herself as well as others around her at different times throughout each day.

##### When she returned from travelling she started working at two different companies that were more inspiring.

When she returned from travelling she started working at two different companies that were more inspiring.

The first company was a PR firm, where she helped to promote new products and services. It was interesting work but it didn't feel like you were making an impact on the world around you. The second job was much better because it felt like you could really help people by creating something new that would change their lives for the better!

##### She now runs a company called Canva, which is based on user-friendly graphic design software designed for people without a lot of graphic design experience.

Canva is a software company based in Australia that's designed for people without a lot of graphic design experience. It's simple to use and can help you create beautiful graphics for your website, blog, Facebook page or any other project you have going on.

Canva was founded by Melanie Perkins who has worked in various positions at Google, including product manager and head of user engagement at Gmail before quitting to start her own business as founder/CEO of Canva in 2014.

##### At first Canva was not profitable because Melanie didn't want to charge her users for the service but then she decided that it was not feasible to run her business without charging people to use the software. The company has been thriving ever since!

Melanie Perkins is the CEO of Canva and she grew up in Australia. She studied at university, worked in marketing and travelled around the world before starting her own business.

Melanie got into graphic design because she loved making things look pretty! The first thing that came to mind was creating logos for companies. Then she started selling them online, which was how she made money. When Canva first launched, it wasn't profitable because Melanie didn't want to charge her users for the service but then she decided that it was not feasible to run her business without charging people to use the softwareâ€”so she did!

Canva currently has over 5 million users worldwide who use our product every day; we're also growing rapidly with new offices opening across Asia Pacific including Singapore where I'm based today - thanks again for reading this far :)

##### Conclusion

Melanie is a young entrepreneur who has achieved great success by being persistent and determined in her business ventures. She has always been entrepreneurial from a young age, as she was inspired by her mother who ran an online boutique when Melanie was growing up. Melanie decided to pursue this dream of hers while still at university where she studied marketing and advertising. She went on to study MBA degree which allowed her to understand how businesses operate better than most people do when they're younger because they have more experience than someone without any formal education or training.
