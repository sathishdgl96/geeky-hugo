Single moms are a growing population. According to the Pew Research Center, they make up nearly 40% of American households with children under 18, but they often have fewer resources and less help than people assume. Single parents have to do so much by themselves that it's easy to forget how much support you actually need. Here are some ways in which single moms can overcome their challenges:

### Single moms make up the fastest growing segment of society.

Single moms are the fastest growing segment of society, and the number is expected to continue growing. Women are having children later in life, which means more single moms. More women are raising their children out of wedlock, which also means more single moms. There are many reasons for this trend:

* The shift from being married at a young age to being an unwed mother has led to fewer marriages and more births outside marriage.
* Women who have had an abortion or who have never been pregnant may not want children right away because they don't want their lives disrupted by another child (some studies show that women who have abortions regret them).

### The biggest challenges are financial.

The biggest challenges are financial. As a single parent, you are the only person who can provide for your child and make sure they have everything they need. This means that you will have to take on more responsibilities than if there were two adults in the home. You'll also be responsible for paying all of the bills and making sure everyone has enough food on their plate at any given time.

It's important not to let these responsibilities overwhelm you or cause stress in your life; however, there is no shame in taking advantage of government assistance programs if necessary!

### Raising children alone is a challenge in itself.

Raising children alone is a challenge in itself. The challenges of being a single parent are many, but they’re nothing compared to the challenges of raising children without a partner.

Children need love and attention from both parents, which can be difficult when one parent is working or going through divorce or separation. Additionally, children may feel abandoned when their parents separate; this can lead them to act out more than usual because they don't understand why it's happening and what will happen next (especially if there was no prenup).

### Surviving as a single parent takes creativity.

As a single parent, you have to be creative in how you do things. You need to be able to manage your finances, time and energy.

You also need to know when it's okay for someone else (like your partner) or even yourself--to help out with something that's important for the family but not urgent right now.

### Networking with other parents is important.

Networking with other parents is important. You'll probably want to ask for help, and you should be honest about it. Don't feel guilty or afraid of failure—you're going through a lot, but so are they! And don't be afraid of success: what's life without some fun?

You may also find yourself judged by those around you—but remember that everyone has different experiences and perspectives, no matter how similar we all look on paper (or even in person). The key here is not letting these judgments keep us from doing something we enjoy, whether that means meeting new people or trying something new out of fear of being judged again.

### It's not easy, but it's worth it.

As a single mom, you'll have your hands full. You're the sole caregiver for your child, and it's an incredible responsibility. You need to earn money to support them and still be there for them when they need you most. You also have to make sure that they're getting the right kind of education so they can succeed in life—and it's not always easy to do this on your own!

But there are so many rewards associated with being a single mother:

* Being able to set boundaries with other people who don't respect those boundaries (e.g., parents)
* Being able to set priorities in life by focusing on what matters most (e.g., spending time with my daughter) instead of getting caught up in things like work or dating someone else because I know how important time spent with her has been for me over the years...

### You can survive, even thrive as a single mom.

As a single mom, you can survive, even thrive. You may be surprised by the fact that being a single parent isn't always easy—but it can be rewarding, too.

You may have heard that having children alone is stressful, but it doesn't have to be! There are ways to find joy and fulfillment in your life as a single parent.

### Conclusion

It can be tough to make ends meet, but as long as you have a positive outlook and are willing to do what it takes, then you'll be able to survive! You might even find yourself able to thrive in this challenging environment.
