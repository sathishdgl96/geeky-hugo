Your children are a bundle of fun. They're there to make your life easier, but they also want to know that their wants and needs are important. The problem is that sometimes, you just can't give them what they want. If this happens, it's important for parents to teach their children how best to handle situations like these by teaching them what not saying no looks like and why it's important.

#### Explain why they can't have what they want.

* Explain why you're saying no.

Be specific about your reasons, and don't use "no" in a way that makes the child feel bad. For example: "I'm going to bed now." It's not enough just to say "goodnight," because then they'll think that their request is rejected out of hand! Instead, try something like this: "I have homework tonight and I need my glasses before I go on reading." The first time this happens (and it will), tell them why again later on as an explanation for your decision. They might even understand why once they hear all of the reasons behind it!

Say no in a reasonable tone of voice.

When you say no to your children, it is important that you do so in a way that they will understand and accept. There are several potential consequences of saying no:

* They may become upset or angry with you. This can cause problems both within the family and between parents and children outside of it.
* You may have to deal with their disappointment or anger at being turned down by others (e.g., teachers).
* They might feel resentful toward others who give them what they want—especially if those things come at a cost to other people's needs or desires (e.g., buying an expensive gift for someone else when money should be spent on something else).

##### Stick to your guns.

You don’t need to justify yourself, and you don’t have to explain why you said no. Saying no is one of the most important things that parents can do for their children.

It's OK if your kids don't understand sometimes—it's called growing up! You are the parent, not them! You can say no without being mean or rude or uncaring (which would defeat the entire purpose).

#### Give them something else to do.

You could always suggest an alternative activity.

If your child is particularly demanding, it might be a good idea to offer them something else to do. This can be as simple as suggesting an activity that doesn't cost money and doesn't involve you helping them with their homework or doing chores around the house (like getting dressed). If your kids are older, they'll probably want something more active—perhaps they'd like some outdoor time or even just some time off from sitting inside watching TV all day long!

#### If a want is reasonable, offer an alternative or make a concession.

If a want is reasonable, offer an alternative or make a concession. For example, if your child wants to play with their friends at the park while you're working on your project at home, tell them that they can play in the backyard. Or maybe you don't want to let them stay up late because it would interfere with schoolwork and need more sleep than usual (which is true).

If this does not satisfy your child's wants and needs—and sometimes it won't—say so. You may have different ideas about what makes sense for your family members' activities or interests; however, there are many ways of saying "no" without making negative comments about each other's choices as parents/caregivers/adults involved in raising children who will eventually grow up into responsible adults themselves someday soon enough...

#### The word "no" is an important one to teach your children.

As a parent, you have to teach your children that saying no is okay. You should also teach them the importance of saying no.

When it comes to other people, children need to learn how and when they can say no. And when it comes to themselves, children need help learning how and when they should say no as well.

#### Summary

We hope this guide has helped you to understand the importance of teaching your children the word "no," how to use it and when it's appropriate. Remember, no matter what age they are, your child will always need a strong foundation in life skills like these.
